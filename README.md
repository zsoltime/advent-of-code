# âœ¨ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ„âœ¨

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles. The solutions are written in JavaScript using Node.js.

## Usage

In this repository you can find my solutions for the puzzles. Each day's solution is located in its own directory.

In these directories you will find:

- `README.md`: the puzzle description
- `input.txt`: my puzzle input; to use your own input text from the puzzle, you can copy/paste it in this file
- `index.js`: my solution
- `index.test.js`: tests for part 1 and part 2 of the puzzle, using the example in the description

You can use `npm start <day>` to get the solutions for that day; e.g. `npm start 01` to get the first day.
